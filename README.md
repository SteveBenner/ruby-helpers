# Ruby Helper Functions
This is my personal collection of code used for aiding web application development in Ruby. It contains code written by myself, as well as code that I've respectfully copied or modified for my own use, from other open-source projects. In all cases where I am not the original author of a piece of code, the name and email of the author is attributed via YARD documentation.
